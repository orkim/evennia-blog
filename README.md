This is the source code to an Evennia based blog I am writing.

The code uses the static site generator pelican, and a theme provided by
pelican-themes. Some of the paths/configs are hard coded for my particular set
up, but everything in \content\ should be able to be generated with only minor
fixes to the config files.
