# Purpose

This is the source code to a blog I am writing which chronicles some of my
experiences.

# Content

There is a category specifically for developing a mud with Evennia. Any articles
in this category will be related to my own experiments.

There is also a general 'How-to' category which is rambling related to other
things I find interesting.

# Setup

The code uses the static site generator pelican, and a theme provided by
pelican-themes. Some of the paths/configs may be hard coded for my particular
set up.

Everything in \content\ is the content I have generated for the blog and it
should be relatively straight forward to get the site to generate.

Where ever this repo is cloned, be sure to clone the pelican-themes repo in the
parent directory.
