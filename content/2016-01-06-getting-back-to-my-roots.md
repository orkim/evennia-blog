It's a new year and time to do something new. Er, something old? Well either
way, I want to document my journey getting back into Evennia. If you're not
familiar with [Evennia](http://www.evennia.com/) go check out the web page. The
TL;DR is that it is a "open-source library and toolkit for building
multi-player online text games (MUD, MUX, MUSH, MUCK, and other MU)."

I'm going to attempt to build out my own design for a world and document it
along the way! Exciting!

I'm going to include my successes, failures, and everything in between. I can't
guarantee that I will be going about things the "correct way" at all, but it
will be my way.

As a side note, I have played with Evennia in previous years (and I even have a
commit or two in the official repo!) but I have been out of the loop for quite
a long time. I do follow the mailing list, typically I'm idling on the IRC
channel and get a few words in once in a while, and I really enjoy the [Evennia
blog](http://evennia.blogspot.com/) that Griatch puts together. However, I
still consider myself a newbie to the code base.

I am starting with a small bonus though (OK, OK, a very very small bonus). Some
of the concepts that Evennia has been built upon I am familiar with due to
playing around with the code base previously. Hopefully we can ride that to
success!

Let's see how this thing works...
