## Intro

OK, it is time to get serious. I mean really serious! I need to get an
environment set up to do some serious work. Did I mention that this is serious?

I'm a big fan of lists, so I'm going to make one to outline all the things I'll
need.

 * Server - Linux; [Debian](http://www.debian.org) or
   [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) will do!
 * Terminal Multiplexer (optional) - [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) or
   [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)
 * Editor - [vim](http://www.vim.org)
 * [git](https://git-scm.com/) - both for Evennia itself, and our game.
 * [Python](http://www.python.org/) - Alternatively
   [IPython](http://www.ipython.org) or [PyPy](http://www.pypy.org/).
 * [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) - for multiple python
   environments.
 * [Evennia](http://www.evennia.com/) - Duh!
 * Mud Client - [tintin++](http://tintin.sourceforge.net/) or an alternative.

The versions available from the distributions repositories are recent enough
for me. A few apt-get commands later and I have got them installed and ready to
begin work.

You might take note that there is a pretty decent amount of software tools
listed above. I really can't stress enough the importance of having a good
understanding of your tools. I've spent many days committing vim commands to
memory, installing/configuring/changing vim plug ins, and playing in my vimrc
file. I've learned to get the muscle memory of tmux commands burned into my
brain.  And "Python" is a whole subject into itself. Take your time, build up
an understanding of each tool and grow with them. Keep growing with them! As
you are more and more comfortable with each of your tools you will become much
more efficient.

## About Evennia Documentation

If you haven't already seen the [Evennia
documentation](https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki) you should go check it
out. It's probably one of the best documented projects around. There are plenty
of comments in the source code itself, there is a wiki *FULL* of information to
go with it, an active [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/evennia), and people on the IRC
channel who can help out just about any time of day. Also, the IRC channel has
logs as well in case you miss something.

There is information all over the place. This sometimes means there are a few
places to visit to piece together everything you may want. Or even in certain
spots that information may contradict itself. However, the quality of
documentation is very high and is one of the best features of Evennia!

With this in mind, I may reference different parts of the documentation to try
to make a single idea or task complete. There are sometimes so many ways to do
something I will draw upon separate sources.

Keep up the good work guys!

## Project Layout

Every project should start off in the right direction, and for my projects I
really like to try to stay organized. Yes, I did say "try" to stay organized.
One of the biggest messes I make for myself is by just throwing around files
here and there until my directories are a mess.  So lets define a logical file
system layout and try to stick to it.

I have decided to use the following structure.

     /home/orkim            - my home directory
     /home/orkim/<gamename> - the (unnamed-so-far) game directory
     /home/orkim/evennia    - my personal Evennia fork (more about this below)
     /home/orkim/venv       - stores all virtualenv that I use

You might have noticed I haven't named the game yet. I like putting those sorts
of things off.

## Evennia Setup

There is a very through guide on [setting up
Evennia](https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Getting%20Started) and I won't
cover it completely since it's already so nice. However, I will say that the
setup it describes is probably not the ideal setup if you are going to do
development/improvements on Evennia itself and submit them back for inclusion.

We need to also incorporate a second wiki article into our setup called
[developer setup](https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Version%20Control) if
we want our own fork of Evennia. This is my preferred method, so that I can
easily submit pull requests should I come across something I can fix/improve.
Between the two wiki pages there is a plethora of information.

Since I'm going to have my own fork of the Evennia repo, I'm going to make
use of my github account, and fork the Evennia repo. The outline of doing this
is pretty straight forward.

  * Fork the repo so I have a copy in my own account.
  * Clone the repo to my computer.
  * Setup a remote in my cloned repo for "upstream" to pull in new changes.

Pushing, pulling, reverting and all sorts of other common developer actions
using git are outlined on the developer setup page.

Here is the boiled down version of getting everything set up assuming a github
account has been made, and the repo already forked.

    orkim@entropy:~$ git clone https://github.com/orkim/evennia.git
    orkim@entropy:~$ cd evennia
    orkim@entropy:~/evennia$ git remote add upstream  https://github.com/evennia/evennia.git

## virtualenv

I'm just about there, but I need a virtualenv (basically, a python install just
for Evennia). This will create a full python environment that I can
activate/deactivate when I want to for Evennia. This has the benefit of
keeping all the packages for Python separated from the system install, and also
you can install/remove/upgrade packages as a normal user. There is no need to
do a system wide install. Win-win!

Assuming all of the prerequisites are installed it is very simple to create a
new environment, activate it, and then have Evennia install the need Python
packages for us.

    orkim@entropy:~$ cd venv
    orkim@entropy:~/venv$ virtualenv --no-site-packages evennia
    orkim@entropy:~/venv$ source evennia/bin/activate
    (evennia)orkim@entropy:~/venv$ cd ~/evennia/
    (evennia)orkim@entropy:~/evennia$ pip install -e .

It's easy to tell if a virtualenv is activated or not due to it adding the name
of the currently activated virtualenv to the command prompt. When done I can
deactivate the environment easily and return to using the system Python
install.

    (evennia)orkim@entropy:~$ deactivate
    orkim@entropy:~$

Simply reactivate it to set the environment up for Evennia again.

    orkim@entropy:~$ source venv/evennia/bin/activate
    (evennia)orkim@entropy:~$

I now have a python installed, activated, and have installed the Python
libraries for Evennia within the virtualenv. I can also activate and deactivate
the environment for Evennia at will. Cool!

## Our Game!

I can't put this off much longer. I've got my environment setup and it's
time to start developing the game. I need to initialize a game, and for that I
must define that <gamename> directory I hinted at earlier to store all of the
game source code.

It shall be named "Treadmore" boomed a voice!

I'm going to use the `evennia` command to initialize, run migrations (set up
the database), and start the server.

Notice that I am using my "evennia" virtualenv and issuing commands in my home
directory.

    (evennia)orkim@entropy:~$ evennia --init treadmore

        Welcome to Evennia!
        Created a new Evennia game directory 'treadmore'.

        You can now optionally edit your new settings file
        at treadmore/server/conf/settings.py. If you don't, the defaults
        will work out of the box. When ready to continue, 'cd' to your
        game directory and run:

           evennia migrate

        This initializes the database. To start the server for the first
        time, run:

           evennia start

        Make sure to create a superuser when asked for it (the email can
        be blank if you want). You should now be able to (by default)
        connect to your server on 'localhost', port 4000 using a
        telnet/mud client or http://localhost:8000 using your web browser.
        If things don't work, check so those ports are open.


    (evennia)orkim@entropy:~$

Now I move into our game directory and run migrations to set the database up.

    (evennia)orkim@entropy:~$ cd treadmore
    (evennia)orkim@entropy:~/treadmore$ evennia migrate
    Operations to perform:
      Synchronize unmigrated apps: staticfiles, admindocs, idmapper, webclient
      Apply all migrations: help, comms, sessions, admin, typeclasses, sites, flatpages, server, players, contenttypes, objects, auth, scripts
    Synchronizing apps without migrations:
      Creating tables...
        Running deferred SQL...
      Installing custom SQL...
    Running migrations:
      Rendering model states... DONE
      Applying typeclasses.0001_initial... OK
    <snipped>
      Applying server.0001_initial... OK
      Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
    (evennia)orkim@entropy:~/treadmore$

I'm ready to start the server up at last! Here we go!

    (evennia)orkim@entropy:~/treadmore$ evennia start

    Create a superuser below. The superuser is Player #1, the 'owner' account of the server.

    Username: orkim
    Email address: orkim@test.com
    Password:
    Password (again):
    <snipped>

A lot more text will scroll by. What we end up with is a AMP server, a MUD
telnet server, and a HTTP server up and running.

As a bonus, the first time I launched the game I was prompted to make an
admin user. Thus, I have everything I need to log in now!

I've connected and created a second user to while testing. I decided I should
name it 'testing' which I feel is pretty original.

####Pro Tip

At this point I went ahead and shutdown the Evennia server and made
a copy of the database. It is called "evennia.db3" and is located in the
~/treadmore/server/ directory. This makes it easy to reset the database after
testing and yet have migrations already complete, and the admin/test user set
up and ready to go.

## Conclusion

Yay! It is all set up and running.

I've made my own fork of the Evennia code base and configured it so that it is
easy to receive updates from 'upstream'. And easy for me to diverge/branch so
I can offer any fixes should I ever make some.

I've named a game, used Evennia to initialize the game and migrated the initial
database.

I can start/stop the server with "evennia start"/"evennia stop" and connect to
it with my clients. I've got an admin user and a test user.

Life is pretty good. Now I can attempt to actually do something with the
game. Where should I begin exploring?
